# MACHINE LEARNING SHOW-CASES FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES
This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks that show-case various machine learning algorithms gearing toward financial services.  I
have compiled those in IBM's Data Science Experience (DSX) using mostly Python, Pandas and Scikit Learn, which provides
user-friendly and intuitive API interfaces within interactive Python sessions.

It is common in financial industry, especially for those companies with long histories, that are not super-accepting or have 
technical, resource, regulatory and skill reasons not to take advantage of new machine learning (supervised, unsupervised,
deep-learning) techniques/algorithms. At the same time, there are many researches and studies done and published in those
topics, which are not terribly relevant to the business objectives of finanical services such as image recognition. This makes those users in financial services feel irrelevant or they, for those who understand the value of machine learning, would spend significant sum of financial and non-financial investment to test/adopt the "new technologies".  Unfortunately, the journey of the adotpion has not been successful for many of those companies due to the issues related to legacy-to-big-data migration which is involved with cost, regulatory and culturual challenges. In addition, the rapid changes in big data technologies and machine learning (AI, Deep Learning included) have been distracting their technical directions.

Given there are many investment decision makers or influencers in those financial services not necessarily familiar with big data, cloud computing, microservices and machine learnings in a technical level, it is critical for us to demonstrate how easy and relevant for those people in financial services to begin with those machine learning techniques, which can be easily applied to or be triggered to tackle their general business objectives/problems such as customer default, contact management, churn predictions or fraud detection, etc. By doing so, we can help those make sound business and investment decisions, and keep their companies abreast of ever-fast changing competition in the midst of 4th Industrial Revolution.  

The Jupyter notebooks in this repo are at the introductory and beginner level so that the users like data scientists or analyts or statisticians in financial services who might be more familiar with traditional languages such as SAS can easily understand and connect the dots between what they have in their production (legacy-based and siloed footprints) and what they can do with remarkable set of machine learnings.

I plan to add more of those notebooks, and love to get feedbacks and support so that the repo can help solve your business problems.
