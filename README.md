# MACHINE LEARNING SHOW-CASES FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES
This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks that show-case various machine learning algorithms gearing toward financial services.  I
have compiled those in IBM's Data Science Experience (DSX) using mostly Python, Pandas and Scikit Learn, which provides
user-friendly and intuitive API interfaces within interactive Python sessions.

The Jupyter notebooks in this repo are at the introductory and beginner level so that the users like data scientists or analyts or statisticians in financial services who might be more familiar with traditional languages such as SAS can easily understand and connect the dots between what they have in their production (legacy-based and siloed footprints) and what they can do with remarkable set of machine learnings.

I plan to add more of those notebooks, and love to get feedbacks and support so that the repo can help solve your business problems.
